# ProductsInExpress

This readme will detail the total deliveries of a Coderhouse backend programming course.

## Deliveries

- [Entrega3](https://github.com/nicolas-jb/ProductsInExpress/tree/main/src/Entrega3) - Make a server project based on node.js that uses the express middleware and deploy the following endpoints on port 8080:

	- Route get '/products' that returns an array with all available products on the server
	- Route get '/productoRandom' that returns a product chosen at random among all the products available

- [Entrega4](https://github.com/nicolas-jb/ProductsInExpress/tree/main/src/Entrega4) - Make a server project based on node.js and express that offer a RESTful API of products. In detail, incorporating the following routes:
	-  GET '/api/productos' 
	-  GET '/api/productos/:id' 
	-  POST '/api/productos' 
	-  PUT '/api/productos/:id' 
	-  DELETE '/api/productos/:id'

- [Entrega5-EJS](https://github.com/nicolas-jb/ProductsInExpress/tree/main/src/Entrega5-EJS) - Using the same product API of the class's deliverable project above, build a web server (not REST) that incorporates with EJS: 
	- A product upload form in the root path (set the path '/productos' to receive the POST, and redirect to the same form).
	- A view of the loaded products in the GET route '/productos'.
	- Both pages will have a button that redirects to the other.


- [Entrega5-PUG](https://github.com/nicolas-jb/ProductsInExpress/tree/main/src/Entrega5-PUG) - Using the same product API of the class's deliverable project above, build a web server (not REST) that incorporates with PUG: 
	- A product upload form in the root path (set the path '/productos' to receive the POST, and redirect to the same form).
	- A view of the loaded products in the GET route '/productos'.
	- Both pages will have a button that redirects to the other.


- [Entrega5-Handlebars](https://github.com/nicolas-jb/ProductsInExpress/tree/main/src/Entrega5-Handlebars) - Using the same product API of the class's deliverable project above, build a web server (not REST) that incorporates with Handlebars: 
	- A product upload form in the root path (set the path '/productos' to receive the POST, and redirect to the same form).
	- A view of the loaded products in the GET route '/productos'.
	- Both pages will have a button that redirects to the other.

- [Entrega6](https://github.com/nicolas-jb/ProductsInExpress/tree/main/src/Entrega6) - - Instruction 1: 
	- Modify the last deliverable so that it has a websocket channel that allows to represent, below the entry form, a table with the list of products in real time (There can be several clients connected simultaneously and in each of them they will be reflected changes made to products without having to reload the view). 
	 - When a client connects, he will receive the list of products to represent in the view.

Aspects to include in the deliverable: To build the dynamic table with the data received by websocket use Handlebars in the frontend. 

- Instruction 2: 
	- We will add a chat channel between the clients and the server to the project.

Aspects to include in the deliverable: 
At the bottom of the entry form, the center of messages stored in the server, where the messages of all the users identified by their email appear. 
The format to be represented will be: 
email (bold text in blue) [date and time DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS)] (normal text in brown) : message (italic text in green) 
Also incorporate two input elements: 
		- One for the user to enter their email (mandatory to be able to use the chat) and another to enter messages and send them using a button. 
	- Messages must persist on the server in a file.
